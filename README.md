## Tasks Completed

### 1. Factory Downtime Analysis using Tableau
- Imported and analyzed telemetry data in Tableau to identify machine health status across factories.
- Created a calculated field called **“Unhealthy”** to mark unhealthy status logs as 10-minute downtime events.
- Built a **“Down Time per Factory”** bar chart and a **“Down Time per Device Type”** chart.
- Combined both charts in a dashboard and enabled interactivity (filtering by factory selection).
  
> The reason the client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:
- `In which location did machines break the most?`
- `What are the machines that broke most often in that location?`

### 2. Gender Pay Equality Classification in Excel
- Worked with an `Equality Table.xlsx` containing Factory, Job Role, and Equality Score fields.
- Created a new column **“Equality Class”** using logical Excel formulas to classify scores into:
  - **Fair** (±10)
  - **Unfair** (>10 or <−10)
  - **Highly Discriminative** (>20 or <−20)
- Enabled the company to quickly identify potential salary bias across job roles and locations.
